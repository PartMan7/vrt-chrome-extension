VRT on Chrome
========================

A Google Chrome extension that takes screen captures of two pages, then compares and diffs the two for visual regression testing. Uses [GoFullPage](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screen-capture/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl) to take screenshots and [see-image-diff](https://www.npmjs.com/package/see-image-diff) to compare said screenshots.
